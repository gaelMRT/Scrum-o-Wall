As part of my training as a technician in computer science at the CFPT, I am asked to complete a diploma work to demonstrate my capacities.
The purpose of this project is to create an application to manage agile projects. This project is centralised on one computer and is touch-based. The datas of the projects are stored in a local database with Access. The user interface is made with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
This project contains a burndown chart to track the activities along the standard agile requirements like the separation of functionalities in User Stories or the different columns to order your workflow. You can link some files to a given User Story to find more easily these files. There is a comment section in each User Story that can be used to give informations about a problem or to discuss about the User Story.
This application is made with the most modular way possible. In that way, the transfer to another database will take a small amount of time. In addition, this application can handle multiple users at the same moment with the multitouch functionality.
